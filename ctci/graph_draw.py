Cracking the Coding Interview
Given a two dimensional graph with points on it,
find a straight line which passes the most points.
The line can start for any point on the y axis and go in any direction

Example input:
[[2,1], [2,2], [2,5], [7,4], [8,8], [8,10], [10,10], [13,13]]
Most point results:
[2,2],[10,10],[13,13] or [1,2], [2,2], [2,5]
Output:
3
