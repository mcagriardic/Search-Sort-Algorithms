Cracking the Coding Interview
Given two squares on a two dimensional plane, find a list that
would cut these two squares in half
Squares are given as arrays with bottom left and top right coordinates as x, y on the plane.
Squares will always be positioned so that a straight line can divide both.
square_1 = [[1, 1], [3, 3]]
square_2 = [[3, 3], [5, 5]]
